Jean Philippe Moulin, has worked with some other famous Champagne brands such as Ruinart, Mumm and Baron de Rothschild. So he definetely knows a thing or two when it comes to making a delicious Champagne. We bought this for a very reasonable price from Naked Wines so we were a little skeptical at first because how good can a cheap Champagne really be? We did do a quick check and 2009 was a fairly good year for Champagne with fruit forward wines produced. 

The wine has a lovely fine bubbles with a green gold colour. It smelt like biscuits, bread dough, yeast with a hint of brown sugar. 

On the palate it was dry and very acidic (not unusal) but it was balanced out well by the creamy mouth-feel and delcious yeasty and doughy flavours. The finish wasn&rsquo;t particuarly long but that isn&rsquo;t uncommon in a sparkling wine. 

With the price being so reasonable (around $50) and it being so delicious there is no option but to give it a five out of five. Like all sparkling wines there is not much that won&rsquo;t go well with it as the acidity can cut through salt and fat easily and the taste isn&rsquo;t too powerful so won&rsquo;t take over the flavour of your food. But naturally you think Champagne and your mind goes to the luxurious foods like oysters, caviar and lobster. 

Unfortunately the 2009 vintage has sold out but if you are a member of Naked Wines <a href="https://www.nakedwines.com.au/producers/jean-philippe-moulin" title="Buy Jean Philippe Moulin Wines" target="_blank">you can get the non vintage.</a>
