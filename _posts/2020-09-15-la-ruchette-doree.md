La Ruchette Dorée is a classic southern French rosé, it focuses on the freshness and aromatic power of the grapes. The vineyards used are very pebbly so heat can get trapped in the pebbles which reflect back into the grapess. This gives the fruits more flavour. Around the vineyard, wild lavender, rosemary and olives grow - hence the label on the bottle.  

The apperance is a classic French rosé colour, a pale salmon colour. On the nose it is really delicate with hints of red berries and a little vanilla (although no oak was used). 

On the palate it is just as delicate, again with red berries notes at the forefront, with a hint of aromatic herbs like basil and citrusy notes like lemon verbena. The wine is high in acdicity but this doesn&rsquo;t take over the taste of the wine. It has a medium body and finish. 

This is a really great crowd pleasing rosé, there&rsquo;s probably not a single person that would complain if you served this at a party. It is great just to drink on it&rsquo;s own but also you can have it with other delicate dishes particuarly ones with lots of herbs like lemon and thyme chicken or caprese salad.
