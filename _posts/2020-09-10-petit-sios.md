Coster del Si贸 is a winery based in Lleida, Spain, which is just by the border of France. The Petit Si贸s series was born to to explore how French and Spanish grapes, techniques and approaches to wine could come together. When it comes to Spanish wines this wine is already pretty extraordinary (for wine buffs) as you would rarely see a Spanish winery using Viognier as this is a French grape.  

The colour of the wine is a deep gold and on the nose it is very pronounced with notes of peaches, apples and pears. 

This wine is just a bold in flavour as it is in smell, as the fruity notes really hit you. The wine is dry, medium bodied, with medium to low acidity, and a nice finish. It is definetely a powerful white wine. 

With it being an aromatic fruity wine, it will go with spicy and umami flavours very well. We also think it could go well with katsu curry and even teryaki as they are sweet in taste and the fruity taste of the wine can stand up to that.
