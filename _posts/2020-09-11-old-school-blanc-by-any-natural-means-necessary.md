The Chateau Maris, is a winery that tries to make wines in the most natural way possible. Think, organic and biodynamic farming, sustainable productions and finding ways to naturally rejuvinate the soil. This doesn&rsquo;t mean it is a natural wine it just uses a minimal and green approach to their wine making. 

The wine is a pale gold in colour. On the nose it is very pronounced with apple and pear notes as well as some floral and lime zest notes. There is a little bit of minerality to it too. 

On the palate is dry with a light to medium body, high acidity, and medium finish. There are hints of apples and pears along with lime zest but there is also a little bit of melon freshness to it. 

It is a really lovely fresh wine which is why we think it is good for salads but with Asian inspired flavours. It would be perfect with a crisp and crunchy East Asian salad. 

In all honesty it&rsquo;s a great wine for almost any occasion! You can check out  <a href="https://www.chateaumaris.com/" title="Chateau Maris" target="_blank">their website</a> for more information about their wines and production techniques.
