Schwarz Wine Co is based in the Barossa Valley, South Australia. The owner and founder Jason Schwarz did a degree in Wine Marketing but through some slight peer pressure he started his own winery. This particular vintage they consider their best yet and some of the vines used date back to 1969 (Grenache) and 1974 (Mataro). 


The wine is salmon in colour. In the video the wine needed to open up a little more in order for us to smell it. Luckily, these reviews are written the next day and this now has fully opened up with notes of strawberries and melon, but it is still not very intense. 

The taste, however, is a different story. It is very juicy and has a sweet quality to it. There is strawberries, cherries and melon flavours that are bursting in your mouth. The body is medium and has a slight creamy-ness to &rsquo;t take over and become sour. There is a high acidity but it isn&rsquo;t as noticeable it is balanced out by the flavours. There is a lovely long finish to the wine too. 

This is a lovely wine, again another crowd pleasing wine. In terms of pairings, it would work well with herby dishes and well as spiced dishes - think like garlic chilli prawns - delish!
