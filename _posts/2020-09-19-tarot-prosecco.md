The Tarot collection from Alpha Box & Dice is four wines (red, white, rosÃ© and sparkling) that are small batch, minimal intervention and vegan. Each has a tarot card depicted on the front which symbolises something about the wine. The Prosecco has the Sun card on the label, which in tarot readings means positivity and vitality. This is due to the drink often used to celebrate success and new beginnings. We used this wine in a comparison video on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chosenwines/" title="Chosen Wines Instagram" target="_blank">our Instagram page</a> where we compared this to Champagne and Cava. Unlike Champagne, Prosecco is not defined by the region it is made in (although Italian&rsquo;s may disagree on this) but the grape used. So only Glera can make Prosecco. 

Similarly to the Champagne, the wine is a green/gold colour but it is a little more pale. On the nose there are notes of apple, lemon and honey.

On the palate it was very acidic which is certainly not unusual for a Prosecco. It is dry, with a fairly short finish. The taste was very applely with a hint of honey. 

Prosecco isn&rsquo;t our first choice for sparkling wine which is why the rating is on the lower side but this is still a great Prosecco. Sparkling wines are really easy to pair as there is not much that won&rsquo;t pair with it. As this is a little fruiter some smoked salmon with lemon drizzled on it or classic fish & chips would be perfect!
