Every summer since 1987 Castillo Perelada hosts a festival which is very prestigious, the cava is in tribute to the stars who have performed there. There has been a winery on the site since the middle ages. Cava is made in a similar way to Champagne, it is left with the yeast of the second fermentation which gives a more rounded quality to the wine. However, it isn&rsquo;t left as long with contact with the yeasts.

The wine has a lovely fine bubbles with pale lemon/gold colour. The wine smells slightly sweet like lemon pie, there is also notes of melon too. 

On the palate it was dry and acidic there is a slightly creamy mouth-feel but not as much as the Champagne. The bubbles are quite soft and there are notes of pear and melon. You can definetely see how it is half way point between Champagne and Prosecco.

Cava is a great way to get similar tastes to Champagne at a fraction of the cost. Sparkling wine is great with most things as it will cut through richness, saltiness and fattiness. With the fruity tastes this will go nicely with Taps or most Spanish food (usually wherever your wine is from the food from that country will pair well with it) and also fish pie.
