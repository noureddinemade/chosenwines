The Tarot collection, from Alpha Box & Dice, has four wines a white, ros√©, red and sparkling. On each bottle&rsquo;s label is a depiction of a tarot card which relates back to the wine. All the wines are small batch, vegan and minimal intervention. On the front of this bottle is the man & woman card. This relates to this perception that Pinot Gris is masculine and Pinot Grigio is more feminine. They are also playing on the idea of masculine and feminine as they have said it is a Pinot Grigio but the flavours of the wine are more in line with what people would describe as Pinot Gris. 

The wine is a orangey-gold colour. On the nose it is fairly pronounced with pears and honeysuckle. There is also a minerality-freshness to it. 

On the palate it is quite bold in flavour, there are notes of pears and golden apples it is a little spicey too. The wine is very acidic but it is nicely balanced out by the fruity flavours of the wine. It is medium bodied with a medium but very nice finish too. 

This is a a great white wine, something you could drink on it&rsquo;s own as it is so flavourful. It could also go with creamier pasta dishes like carbonara as it has a creamier mouth-feel than most white wines. As well as some chicken and hearty fish dishes.
