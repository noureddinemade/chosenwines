In 2006 Fattoria di Caspri decided to practice organic farming throughout their estate. They also take this one step further by also applying the principles of biodynamic farming. 

The wine is a light red with a brown hue to it. On the nose there is a herbal and vegetal quality to it. There is also hint of red berries but it is hard to determine exactly what. 

On the palate it is not as bold and powerful as some of the other reds we&rsquo;ve tried, and it is more of a medium bodied red. Since we filmed the video the wine has had a chance to open up a little more and there is less of a fruity quality. The herbal and vegetal qualities are definetely more apparent, there is almost like a soil taste to it as well. There are some sharp red berries at the back of the palate like cranberry and red currants. 

We feel this is a good all-round red and does have the best of both worlds as it still has a good and relatively powerful flavour but has a lighter body. With it being a red wine it lends itself to being paired with red meat. We can also seeing it working well with umami flavours.

We got this from a restaurant who were selling some wines during lockdown but you can <a href="http://fattoriadicaspri.com/" title="Fattoira Di Caspri Website" target="_blank">visit the wineries website.</a>
